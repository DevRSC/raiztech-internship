## Thoughts on the Assignment

<p>I must say, the assignment was a refreshing challenge that got me all excited. I had the chance to delve into some new concepts and apply them in a practical sense. The instructions were clear, which made grasping the requirements an absolute breeze. The additional points awarded for using TypeScript and implementing pagination were rather daunting at first. I have faced multiple logic errors, but let me tell you, the sense of fulfillment when I nailed them was unparalleled. All in all, I'd say this project was a true testament to my capabilities as a frontend developer.

Now, I have to admit that my specialty is Mobile Development using React Native. However, I was still able to use my skills in React for this website. I did hit a few bumps in the road, so to speak. Bugs and logic errors, to be precise. But, as luck would have it, I was able to troubleshoot and resolve them all. It wasn't a easy, but I was able to complete the task on time.

To summarize, this project was a complex and perplexing journey, with its fair share of highs and lows. But it was also a thoroughly satisfying one, and I'm pleased to report that I came out on top.</p>
